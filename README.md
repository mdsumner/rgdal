## rgdal


This is a fork of the rforge-mirror of the rgdal package. 

Branch master is kept up to date with https://github.com/rforge/rgdal.git regularly, so this will stay in the
"traditional" state. 

We can set up automated testing and PR proposals, but we won't commit to the master branch here. 

I have set the default branch to 'readme.idea', I'm just figuring out how to go about this for now.
